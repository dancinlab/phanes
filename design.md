### Decision 2 — Brand name = Phanes (파네스)

**picked**: `Phanes` (파네스) — Orphic primordial deity of revelation
(φαίνω, "to bring to light"), depicted entwined by the OUROBOROS.

**rationale**:
- **Lore is a strict superset of the engine's true name.** hexa-lang's
  engine codename is OUROBOROS; in myth Phanes is the radiant first-born
  the OUROBOROS entwines. So the name is authentic, not retrofitted —
  Ouro = mechanism, Phanes = the light it reveals.
- **Semantic precision over Palantir.** Palantir = a seeing-stone (passive
  observation). phanes *generates + verifies* (φαίνω = actively bring
  hidden truth to light) — a closer myth for a discovery+falsification
  engine.
- **Mythic credibility (Palantir/Anduril school).** Obscure-but-
  pronounceable primordial deity → instant gravitas; fits dancinlab's
  short-evocative naming tone (echoes/wisp/flame/forge).
- **User directive 2026-05-19 "파네스 go"** — chosen after the assistant
  presented, with web-search evidence, an ownability caveat (see risk).

**risk on record (g3 honesty — not a blocker, user override logged)**:
Adjacent trademark collisions — **Phanes Technologies** (autonomous
multi-agent AI, same lane) + **Phanes Therapeutics** (USPTO-registered
TMs, pharma). Clean fallbacks evidenced clean by web search: `Ouro` /
`Kythera` / `Haechi` / `Bythos`. Mitigation: treat Phanes as project
narrative/lore; run formal USPTO class-42 clearance before any public
launch or remote/org push; reconsider public-facing mark then.
(Governance: `AGENTS.tape @D g_name_risk`.)

### Decision 4 — GitHub org + remote = dancinlab/phanes (private)

**picked**: `github.com/dancinlab/phanes` — **private** repo; `origin`,
`main` tracking `origin/main`, scaffold pushed (commit `38e5992`).

**rationale**:
- **User directive 2026-05-19 "github.com/dancinlab/phanes"** — explicit
  org + name, after the assistant flagged the dancinlab→singularity rename
  ambiguity rather than guessing an outward, hard-to-reverse action.
- **Private, not public launch.** The `@D g_name_risk` clearance
  obligation is scoped to *public launch*; a private repo defers (does not
  void) it. Trademark clearance stays tracked, owed before going public.
- **dancinlab org = upstream-consistent.** Matches hexa-lang AGENTS.tape
  citations (`github.com/dancinlab/...`) and the shipped sibling
  `dancinlab/echoes-experience` deployment pattern.
- Auth: `gh` account `dancinlife`, scopes incl. `repo` — create+push
  succeeded; no LICENSE committed yet (Decision 5, commercial — not
  auto-MIT).

---

### Decision 1 — Product scope = B (Generic cycle platform)

**picked**: `B` — generic autonomous-cycle platform: a company brings a
measurable objective + a verifier/oracle; phanes drives hexa kick's
`goal → falsifier → saturation` loop against it and returns a verified,
provenance-tracked result/catalog. Pluggable seed + tenant verifier.

**rationale**:
- **User directive 2026-05-19 "B"** — chosen over the assistant
  recommendation (A); the larger-TAM strategic bet is the user's call and
  is recorded as the decisive factor.
- **Accepted build implication**: B's genuine engine delta vs A is a
  **NEW pluggable seed+verifier/oracle abstraction** over `hexa kick`
  (A reused the internal honesty gate + `gate/ hexa://kick` pipeline
  as-is). This abstraction is an upstream hexa-lang `inbox/patches/`
  candidate, not a downstream fork (`@I id002` · `@D g_inbox_patches`).
- **Honest-scope risk now ACTIVE (g3)**: B's value prop ("drive *your*
  objective to done") structurally collides with the advisory,
  non-blocking honesty gate — saturation / round-cap is the only hard
  stop. Mandated mitigation: the **tenant-supplied verifier is the sole
  authority of record** for "objective met"; phanes surfaces saturation +
  verifier verdict and never claims objective-met without the tenant
  verifier's PASS. `@D g_honest_scope` tightened with a `scope_b` clause.
- **Not foreclosed**: narrowing B → A/C for v1 (if the verifier
  abstraction proves too broad) stays available; recorded so the option
  is not lost.

---

### Decision 3 — Deployment shape = 가+다 (public demo funnel + full dashboard)

**picked**: `가 + 다` — a public, round-capped **demo site** (marketing
funnel) AND a full authenticated **dashboard** (job submit · result
browser · catalog · billing). The job **API is the shared substrate**
beneath both — not a competing third product.

**rationale**:
- **User directive 2026-05-19 "가+다"** — chosen over the assistant
  recommendation (나 API-only v1); the richer two-surface bet is the
  user's strategic call, recorded as decisive.
- **Honest constraint MANDATED (g3 · scope_b)**: a public demo for a B
  platform must **not** accept arbitrary tenant verifiers (over-claim +
  arbitrary-compute security hole). The demo runs **only preset, curated
  objective+verifier scenarios**, round-capped and sandboxed; arbitrary
  verifier submission is **authenticated/paid-only** via the dashboard.
  Enforced by `@D g_public_demo_constraint`.
- **Accepted implication**: largest front-end surface (two UIs + billing)
  — echoes-experience minimalism is harder. Sequencing stays disciplined:
  API substrate → minimal dashboard slice → public demo, each thin, not
  big-bang.
- **API retained, not discarded**: the (나) work is the substrate both
  surfaces consume — it is the foundation layer, fully kept.

### Decision 6 — Multi-tenant overlay isolation = 다 (hybrid)

**picked**: `다` — per-job `$HOME`-jail / sandbox now (downstream, ships
v1) **+** a parallel hexa-lang `inbox/patch` for a first-class
`HX_DATA_DIR` (canonical path). Drop the `$HOME`-hijack once upstream
lands; keep the per-job sandbox as defense-in-depth.

**rationale**:
- **Evidence-grounded, low risk**: `compiler/drill/checkpoint.hexa:53`
  resolves the data dir from `env("HOME")` (overlay mirrors it); the
  engine's *own* test suite isolates via per-base `$HOME`
  (`mkdir -p $base/.hx/data`). (가) is a verified upstream idiom — works
  today, zero engine change.
- **Governance-correct**: `@I id002` · `@D g_inbox_patches` mandate
  engine gaps go upstream — a first-class `HX_DATA_DIR` is the canonical
  fix, filed as `phanes-hx-data-dir-per-tenant-isolation`. Pure-(가)
  alone would be a forbidden permanent downstream workaround.
- **Confidentiality non-negotiable**: a per-job sandbox = zero
  cross-tenant discovery leakage; retained as defense-in-depth even after
  the upstream knob lands.
- **Concurrency sub-risk (recorded)**: the engine currently *serializes*
  concurrent dispatch via `cmd_drill_batch` under a single `$HOME`
  (`checkpoint.hexa:26`). Per-job `$HOME` isolation is precisely what
  enables safe concurrent multi-tenant jobs — to be validated in the
  compute-plane design, not assumed.

**upstream handoffs filed (hexa-lang `inbox/patches/`, untracked drafts —
the established inbox mechanism; pin `50f5f073` rfc043-hexa-torch)**:
1. `phanes-hx-data-dir-per-tenant-isolation` — first-class `HX_DATA_DIR`
   / `--overlay --checkpoint` (this decision's (나) half).
2. `phanes-pluggable-verifier-oracle-for-drill-loop` — scope-B's
   in-loop tenant-verifier extension point (the B-surface gap).
