## P0 — Foundations · DONE (2026-05-19)

Repo, governance (AGENTS.tape), GOAL/design/README/LICENSE, decision
gates 1–6, two upstream handoffs filed to hexa-lang `inbox/patches/`.

## P1 — Job API substrate (the (나) layer everything sits on) · P1a + P1b DONE (measured 2026-05-19)

The spine both surfaces consume. Minimal authenticated service:

- `POST /job {seed, verifier_ref, rounds_cap}` → enqueue
- worker spawns `hexa kick` on the **Linux fleet** (Mac native forbidden
  by hexa-lang Axis D) in a **per-job `$HOME`-jail sandbox**, with
  `HEXA_VAL_ARENA=0` (cycle-h36 arena-aliasing fix), seed validated
  (`_validate_seed`), round/wall capped
- capture JSON `DrillResult` + overlay → `GET /job/:id`,
  `GET /job/:id/result`
- auth = API key; per-tenant sandbox dir = isolation
- reference: hexa-lang `gate/ hexa://kick?topic=` + `drill_bg_spawn`
  (≈70% of an async-job pipeline already)

Exit: one tenant, one job, end-to-end, isolated, measured.

**P1a status — DONE, measured (2026-05-19, arm64 macOS local):**
- `service/job_runner.sh` — verified engine-invocation contract: per-job
  `$HOME`-jail + `HEXA_VAL_ARENA=0` + seed pre-validate + rounds clamp +
  capture (stdout `DrillResult` JSON + `overlay.n6`) + wall meter.
- `service/jobctl.sh` — filesystem job store: `init-tenant / submit /
  get / result`, API-key auth, per-tenant dir isolation.
- `service/API.md` — HTTP contract for P1b (1:1 skin, mechanical).
- Measured: cheap oracle (1 round) rc=0, overlay ONLY in jail, real
  `~/.hx/data` untouched; full self-test init→submit→get→result PASS,
  wrong-token → rc=4. Decision 6 (가) `$HOME`-jail isolation **proven,
  not asserted**.
- **P1a honest gaps (recorded, not hidden)**: wall meter is
  integer-second — too coarse for sub-second jobs, refine to ms in P2
  (billing basis). No concurrency test yet (P2, `checkpoint.hexa:26`
  serialization concern). HTTP transport not built (P1b).

**P1b status — DONE, measured (2026-05-19, hexa-native HTTP server):**
- `service/http_phanes.hexa` — hexa program using `stdlib/net` (server +
  request + response). Routes per `service/API.md`: GET `/v1/healthz`,
  POST `/v1/jobs`, GET `/v1/jobs/:id`, GET `/v1/jobs/:id/result`. Auth =
  `Authorization: Bearer` + `X-Phanes-Tenant`. Handlers shell out to
  `service/jobctl.sh` (the verified substrate — true 1:1 skin).
- `service/build.sh` — builds via upstream `hexa` toolchain
  (HEXA_HOME=~/core/hexa-lang). 393KB arm64 Mach-O, clean clang build.
- `web/index.html` — vanilla JS + Canvas single-file dev console
  (echoes-experience template, "기존 생태계" frontend = static, no bundler).
- **Measured smoke (7/7 PASS)**: healthz · submit · get · result · seed-
  intact assertion (seed containing `=` preserved verbatim) · no-auth
  → 401 · bad-JSON → 400. Wall ≈ 0.5s for submit, JSON body parsed via
  `json_parse` builtin.
- **Measured fix on record (g3)**: P1b smoke v1 used form-encoded body;
  `stdlib parse_query` splits naively on every `=`, truncating seeds
  containing `=`. Pivoted to JSON body + `json_parse`; seed-intact
  assertion now PASS. Documented in `service/http_phanes.hexa`.

**Upstream win on record**: the `phanes-hx-data-dir-per-tenant-isolation`
handoff was **resolved SSOT 2026-05-19** in hexa-lang — `hx_data_dir()`
helper added with precedence `HX_DATA_DIR > $HOME/.hx/data > ".hx/data"`,
all 4 call sites switched, parse-gate clean. Binary promote pending
(standard separate deploy step); phanes keeps `$HOME`-jail until then,
swaps to `HX_DATA_DIR` after promote with sandbox as defense-in-depth
(@ P2).

## P2 — Compute-plane hardening · P2.1 + P2.2 + P2.4 measured (2026-05-19)

**P2.1 wall meter ms — DONE measured.** `job_runner.sh` adopts perl
`Time::HiRes` ms clock (`phanes_now_ms`); `job.json` now carries both
`wall_ms` (billing basis) and `wall_sec` (back-compat). Sub-second
resolution verified: 1-round kick reports `wall_ms=1312`.

**P2.2 concurrency — MEASURED, honest finding.**
`service/concurrency_test.sh` fires N=4 parallel HTTP submits:
- ✅ **Isolation HOLDS**: 4 distinct job ids, each with its own
  `job.json` + `overlay.n6` (per-job `$HOME`-jail works under concurrent
  load — Decision 6 (가) verified at N=4).
- 🟡 **Service-layer serialization (predicted, measured)**: ratio
  `concurrent/baseline = 4.4/10` ≈ fully serialized. Root cause:
  `stdlib/net/http_server.hexa::server_serve` is a sequential accept-loop
  (one connection processed before the next accept). NOT a per-job
  isolation failure — execution layer.

**P2.x — DONE measured (async-submit pivot, 2026-05-19).** Reading
`stdlib/net/concurrent_serve.hexa` docstring revealed the port would NOT
help: "Stage0 blocking net_accept 때문에 실제로는 단일 스레드 직렬
처리이지만 work-stealing deque 를 매개로 하여 logical concurrency 형태를
유지한다. 멀티 OS 스레드는 roadmap 62 통합 후 활성화." Instrument-first
saved a substantial rewrite (cheap-oracle: read the docstring).
**Pivot**: decouple HTTP throughput from kick wall at the **job
dispatcher layer** instead. `service/jobctl.sh submit` backgrounds
`job_runner.sh` (`nohup … & + disown`) and returns the `job_id`
immediately; the kick runs in a detached child process. `job_runner.sh`
atomic-writes status transitions (`queued → running → done/failed` via
tmp+rename so concurrent GETs never see partial JSON). New upstream
inbox filed: `phanes-stdlib-net-os-thread-concurrency-roadmap-62` (the
gap escalation; once landed, http_phanes.hexa can drop the async detour).
**Measured (2026-05-19)**:
- `baseline_submit_ms = 162`  (vs pre-pivot 1530 — HTTP returns fast)
- `baseline_kick_ms   = 1364` (full submit → done for 1 job)
- 4-way concurrent submit total = `389ms` (submit-only ratio 2.4/10 —
  HTTP still serial at accept-loop, expected)
- 4-way end-to-end completion = `2360ms` (end-to-end ratio 1.7/10 vs
  baseline_kick — **engine PARTIAL parallel** on multi-core, contention
  < 1.5× per kick)
- **Absolute throughput vs pre-pivot ~2.9× (6795 → 2360ms for 4 jobs).**
- per-job statuses all `done`, isolation HOLDS at N=4.

**P2.3 `HX_DATA_DIR` adoption — PENDING upstream binary promote.**
Probe (2026-05-19): running `bin/hexa-absorbed-kick` (May 18 build) does
NOT honor `HX_DATA_DIR`. SSOT helper landed in hexa-lang same day, but
binary promote is the standard separate deploy step (per the upstream
resolution comment, the 22c27a05 pattern). phanes keeps the `$HOME`-jail
until promote; after promote, `job_runner.sh` will add
`HX_DATA_DIR="$JAIL/.hx/data"` to its env line, drop the `$HOME` hijack,
and keep the sandbox as defense-in-depth. No new inbox needed — already
on upstream lifecycle.

**P2.4 post-hoc tenant verifier hook — DONE measured.** `job_runner.sh`
gains `--verifier PATH` (+ `--verifier-timeout` default 120s). Exec in
the `$HOME`-jail with a tightened env (`env -i HOME=… PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`)
+ hard `timeout`. `jobctl.sh submit` auto-attaches per-tenant
`verifier.sh` (admin-placed for P2; tenant-upload endpoint = P3).
`job.json` carries `verifier_rc` (the tenant verifier's exit code —
under `@D g_honest_scope.scope_b` this is the sole authority for
"objective met"). Measured: example verifier (threshold-on-total) →
`verifier_rc=0` PASS. **Sandbox honesty on record (g3)**: this is a thin
POSIX sandbox (env reset + timeout), NOT container/firejail; P3
production hardening adds true containerization + no-network etc.

**P2.5 production Linux fleet routing — DEFERRED (P3-coupled).**
hexa-lang Axis-D forbids Mac-native `hexa kick` for production routes;
the engine must run on Linux fleet (ubu-2 / production hosts). Path
forward: `job_runner.sh` honors `PHANES_ENGINE_HOST` env (ssh to
`<host> "PHANES_HEXA_HOME=… HEXA_VAL_ARENA=0 timeout … bin/hexa-absorbed-
kick --seed … --rounds N"`, capture stdout/stderr/overlay back via
`rsync`/`scp`). Sub-blocker: kick binary distribution to Linux x86_64
(ubu can't self-host arm). Recorded for P3 production hardening phase;
not coded this turn.

**P2.6 second upstream patch tracking.** `phanes-pluggable-verifier-
oracle-for-drill-loop` still pending hexa-lang response (no resolution
yet). phanes's post-hoc hook (P2.4) is the interim — the in-loop hook
remains the authoritative goal once landed.



Per-tenant sandbox confinement; round/wall metering (billing basis);
**concurrency** — validate the `cmd_drill_batch` single-`$HOME`
serialization concern (`checkpoint.hexa:26`) under isolated per-job
`$HOME`; verifier sandbox + timeout (untrusted tenant code); abuse/rate
limits. Adopt upstream `HX_DATA_DIR` when it lands → retire `$HOME`
hijack, keep sandbox as defense-in-depth.

## P3 — Dashboard (Decision 3 = 다)

Accounts/orgs auth; job-submit UI incl. verifier upload/reference;
result browser + **per-tenant discovery catalog** (their private echoes,
exportable); billing/metering console. Sits entirely on the P1 API.

## P4 — Public demo funnel (Decision 3 = 가)

Static landing (echoes-experience deploy pattern) + **preset/curated
objective+verifier scenarios only**, round-capped, sandboxed
(`@D g_public_demo_constraint` — NO arbitrary verifier on the
unauthenticated surface). CTA → dashboard signup.

## P5 — Pre-public-launch gates

Trademark clearance USPTO class-42 (`@D g_name_risk`) BEFORE public;
upstream patches landed or interim documented (`HX_DATA_DIR` +
pluggable verifier); honest-scope marketing review (`@D g_honest_scope`
· `g_public_demo_constraint` — no over-claim, tenant verifier = sole
authority).
